Plugin that sends heartbeat stream event.

Stream events are associated with a project ref for visibility purposes so the heartbeat is no different. The defaut settings will send an event on the refs/meta/config ref of the All-Projects project every 15 seconds.

To configure heartbeat, refer to [config](config.html) documentation.
